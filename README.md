#Summary

1.Loading and preparing data

EEG data is loaded from designated directories, and files are divided into task and rest states according to their names.
Calculates the Power Spectral Density for each band and defines frequency bands for EEG analysis.
Plots PSDs for several subjects in both the rest and task states.

2.Utilized models

EEGNet: It seeks to effectively identify patterns in EEG waves.
TSCeption: It combines convolutional and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features from input data.
VAE: The system is comprised of a probabilistic encoder and decoder network that are linked via a latent space.

3.Evalution and Metrics

Models are assessed using measures like F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision.
Compares the way the TSCeption and EEGNet models perform on classification tests.
Evaluates Mean Squared Error and reconstruction quality for the VAE.

4.Visualization and Saving:

Visualizes original and reconstructed EEG samples from the VAE.
Saves trained models for future use.

5.This code provides:

Extensive workflow that focuses on EEG data analysis 
Latent representation learning utilizing neural networks and VAEs,
From data loading and preprocessing to deep learning modeling and evaluation.

6.Result

EEGNet's overall performance metrics seem to suffer as a result of its apparent difficulty appropriately classifying negative events.
TSCeption performs better than any other metric, demonstrating its efficacy in EEG classification tasks.
VAE indicates a validation loss calculation problem. 
Reconstruction's MSE is reasonable, indicating a respectable level of reconstruction quality.
